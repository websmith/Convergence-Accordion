This is a simple, but helpful accordion widget for Convergence CMS version 3.

### Installation
To use, place the code in your site. I recommend integrating the code into existing files to avoid making extra http requests. The displays folder can be copied directly into the root directory of your Convergence site. Feel free to edit the styles to match the theme of your site.

### Usage
Once installed and uploaded to the server, you can create new accordions simply by creating Blog modules. To turn a blog into an accordion, open the settings panel for the Blog and under "How do you want to display this Blog" select the new "Accordion" option.

### Issues
Please report all issues to me via GitHub so I can update the widget as necessary.
